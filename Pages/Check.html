    <h2>Most Mysterious Song On The Internet</h2>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Amplify13/Pro_Web/main/Photos/Like_the_Wind.webp" alt="Casette tape" height="300" width="500">    <p>In 2004 an internet user named Darius uploaded this clip to a website with many other songs looking for identification for the songs. As most of the songs went on the be discovered, one remained unsolved. When pressed for more information, Darius stated hee recorded it from a North German public radio station called Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR) to use in a mixtape. Darius had purposely removed all radio host dialogue, which is cited as being the reason why so little is known about the song.</p><br>
    <p>The true hunt began on March 18th of 2007 when Darius' older sister, Lydia, began searching for it on a Usenet group before spreading out the other places. The most popular places it spread to was the website WatZatSong in 2009, YouTube in 2011, and a Spanish indie record label named Dead Wax in 2017. Someone involved with Dead Wax opened up their own personal search for the song in 2019, leading to the biggest search effort yet.</p><br>
    <p>The new search effort yeilded good results shortly after beginning, when on July 12 a Reddit user was able to track down the complete version of the song from one of Lydia's Usenet posts before it was deleted. People continued the search by contacting many people, most notiably Paul Baskerville. Paul was the disc jockey for NDR during the time and couldn't provide any new information, but on July 21st of 2019 he did play it again on his current radio shows to no avail.</p><br>

    <p>The next big break was on July 9th of 2020 when a user obtained a full list of all songs played on NDR in 1984. After searching, all songs on the list could be found which ruled out that they were played on the block Paul DJed in 1984. In December of the same year a list of all songs played on the block Paul DJed arrived and it was clear that the song was never played on Paul's block of the radio station. In January of 2021 lists were received from other blocks of the songs played in October and November of 1984. On these lists multiple songs recorded in mixtapes by Darius appeared, showing the song was most likely within these blocks.</p><br>
    <p>In late 2020 a Discord user analyzed the tape recording and found a 10 kHz line. This line was on all NDR radio broadcasts and in no other German broadcasts, meaning the song had to come from an NDR block. The final update within this situation came in November 2nd of 2021 when Lydia posted that one of her sons found a box of tapes, one of which contained a higher quality version of the song. This recording's track list was different, but the recording of the song shared the same artifacts as the older copy. This showed that this tape was made using the original recording.</p>
