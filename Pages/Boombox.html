    <p>On October 7th of 2021, a user named carl92 on watzatsong.com posted a song and asked for help identifying the song. He quickly ruled out other songs in the comments, and answered an inquery about where he recorded the audio from. Carl states he doesn't remember where he recorded it from and that the file was found in a DVD backup for an older computer. The boombox commonly associated with the song came from when Youtuber Jay Kay uploaded the snippet of the song to his Youtube channel with the pink boombox picture.</p><br>

    <p>The hunt has resulted in multiple false leads and theories. One theory suggeests the song was made for a TV commercial in the 80s. This was reached by some searchers due to the fact the audio has a 15.734 kHz pilot tone, something only in MTS broadcasts within a select few countries or found on foreign CRT TVs tuned into a North American station. But this also means the song could have been recorded from anything on a CRT TV, not just a commercial. However, people still search through 80s commercial compilations with the hope they'll find it.</p><br>
    <p>Another popular theory is that the song is from a non-English speaking country due to how the singer pronounces words. Searchers commonly shift through different Asian 80s pop songs and artists with the hope the song will show up there.</p><br>
