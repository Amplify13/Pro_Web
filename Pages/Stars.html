    <h2>Under The Stars</h2>

    <p>On July 5th, 2021, a Facebook user named Jitomate Triste shared a video in multiple groups asking for the name of a song. The video is a portion of an unknown song and the visuals are edited scenes from Disney's <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>.</p><br>

    <p>This original post did not attract much attention and the Facebook account responsible for posting the video went down, however, it was re-uploaded to YouTube in September, sparking the hunt.</p><br>
    <p>The first breakthrough was in mid-October of 2021. A YouTube user named Yo yoyo suggested that the band responsible could be a Chilean band called Gin & Tonic. Yo, yoyo had found a clip of the band practicing uploaded to YouTube in 2006 on a channel called Bandas de Chile.</p><br>

    <p>Searchers quickly began looking into Gin & Tonic to discover they had formed in 2001, broken up in 2005, and made one album called Free as the Sun. Along with this, a high-quality rip of the album was tracked down, giving searchers a better comparison between Gin & Tonic and the unknown song.</p><br>

    <p>By the end of October, somebody had contacted Gin & Tonic's lead singer Ricardo Mendez, and asked him about the song. Ricardo gave odd responses to being asked about the song and danced around the questions before finally agreeing to do a recreation of the song, titling it "Under The Stars".</p><br>

    <p>Where the search currently stands, some people believe Ricardo Mendez is responsible for the song and others think he is not. The search has continued under the pretense that Ricardo is <b>not</b> the singer and only a few other groups have been discovered and ruled out in the meantime.</p>
