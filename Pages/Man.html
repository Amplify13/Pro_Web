    <p>On April 6th of 2017, a Soundcloud user named Arthur Bogushev uploaded a clip of an unknown song.</p>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JccbI-hy-fM?si=VPPVYdnfIEAr2MR2" title="YouTube video player" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen class="mImg"></iframe>
    <p>This clip went largerly unnoticed by the internet until someone commented on the original Soundcloud posting in March of 2023 asking where the audio was recorded from. Arthur replied and told the commenting user the song was recorded from a Ukrainian radio station around 2012 using an MP3 player, so the radio station sign off was not given.</p><br>
    <p>No further attention was given to the case until around the end of 2023 and the begining of 2024, when the audio blew up on Tik Tok and an active search began for the song. Youtuber ShaiiValley (a member of the Lost Media community) uploaded a video on Febuaray 5th of 2024 that covered a collection of internet oddities, including There's A Man. This spotlight added more fuel to the fire and the hunt ramped up to find the song.</p><br>
    <p>As I was collecting infomation for this website, this song was discovered in full! Reddit user TrippyDrew used a Youtube feature that allows someone to look up videos from before a specific date. Looking up "Man on the hill before:2013" produced a video from 2008 of a group called The Defended performing the song in Glasgow in 2008.</p><br>

    <p>Further research produced nothing about the band, but using the Wayback Machine their band page was discovered along with a copy of the full song.<p><br>

    <p>Since the discovery of the song, it's popularity has reached back to the official band and they've begun to put their music online and engaging with people about their music! As of creating this webpage no performances are scheduled, but there is a possibility it could occur!</p>
